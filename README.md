# Python Project - 2024/2025 NBA Season Team & Player Analysis
## Introduction
My name is Ryan Oka and this is my Python Project for the NYC Data Science Academy Bootcamp. I utilized Jupyter Notebook to manipulate my data and various libraries such as Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to build my visualizations.
## Overview
The dataset came from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/eduardopalmieri/nba-player-stats-season-2425/versions/23/data) and contained only partial season data (around 20+ games per team) for the 2024/2025 season. Within the dataset was each player's statistics for every game as well as the result of the game. 

The goal of my project was to analyze and tell a story on what data trends are most influential in wins and losses. My approach was to analyze the impact on team results by taking various angles in the data. This included:
* Individual player statistics
* Aggregated team statistics
* Identifying specific players and teams that were outliers in the data

## Project
This project allowed me to learn and practice my Python skills in grouping the data, parsing out and filtering data to merge, and creating new functions/columns within the data. I was also able to utilize various different visualizations to help me identify trends in the data. As an avid sports fan, this allowed me to pursue my passions for the NBA and gain better insights on what the data from the game can be utilitzed for.
